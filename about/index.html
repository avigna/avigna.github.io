			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
			I am a <a href="https://dark.nbi.ku.dk/">DARK</a> Fellow at the <a href="https://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/">Niels Bohr Institute</a>, 
			affiliated to the <a href="https://www.ku.dk/english/">University of Copenhagen</a>.<br><br>
			
			My research focusses on the progenitors, evolution and fate of massive binary stars. 
			Interacting binaries give rise to a wide variety of transients such as stellar mergers, 
			X-ray binaries, pulsars, supernovae, gamma-ray bursts and gravitational-waves, to name a few. 
			I use different numerical methods, such as detailed stellar evolution and rapid population synthesis, 
			to understand the most relevant astrophysical processes at different phases. 
			I am a member and developer of <a href="https://compas.science/">Team COMPAS</a>, 
			a software which simulates and studies massive binary evolution.
			My current research revolves around double neutron star systems and stellar mergers 
			leading to (pulsational) pair-instability supernovae.<br><br>
				
			I earned my PhD from the <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/gravitational-wave/index.aspx">Institute for Gravitational Wave Astronomy</a> 
			at the University of Birmingham in England. I spent the last year of my PhD as a visitor at the
			<a href="https://www.monash.edu/moca">Monash Centre for Astrophysics</a> in Melbourne, Australia, 
			as part of the <a href="https://www.ozgrav.org/">OzGrav</a> collaboration. 
			I earned my bachelor degree in theoretical physics from the <a href="http://www.uaslp.mx/">Universidad Autónoma de San Luis Potosí</a> in México.
